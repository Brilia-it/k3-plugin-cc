# Kimi Result

Forward this request to the local kimi-code companion runtime by shell. Do not use MCP for this skill.

## Invocation

- Resolve the plugin root: prefer `$PLUGIN_ROOT` if the host sets it; otherwise use the directory that CONTAINS the `skills/` directory (i.e. two levels up from this `SKILL.md`).
- Sanity check: `<plugin-root>/scripts/companion.sh` must exist — it is the bundled entrypoint that resolves Node and runs the compiled runtime from `<plugin-root>/dist/`.
- Launch the shell command from the user's current workspace directory so `scripts/companion.sh` captures the intended workspace cwd.
- Run: `PLUGIN_ROOT="<plugin-root>" "<plugin-root>/scripts/companion.sh" result <args>`
- Data directories: standard cache installs verify shared `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA`/`PLUGIN_DATA` against this package's own host-specific directory. On `PLUGIN_DATA_CONFLICT`, surface the error; do not automatically choose a new store or copy data. An explicit absolute `KIMI_PLUGIN_CC_DATA` selects a custom data parent (the runtime appends `kimi-plugin-cc/`). Checkouts retain unambiguous legacy variables and the Codex fallback under `CODEX_HOME` or `HOME`; a launch with no home needs an explicit data root.

## Arguments

Pass through: `[<job-id>] [--type <review|challenge|rescue|review_gate|ask>] [--json]`

## Handling

- Preserve any job id, `--type`, and `--json` flag.
- Return companion stdout verbatim; `--json` is the structured automation surface.
